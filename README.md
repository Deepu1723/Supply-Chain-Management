What Is Supply Chain Management (SCM)?
Supply chain management (SCM) is the monitoring and optimization of the production and distribution of a companyâ€™s products and services.
It seeks to improve and make more efficient all processes involved in turning raw materials and components into final products and getting them to the ultimate customer. 
Effective SCM can help streamline a company's activities to eliminate waste, maximize customer value, and gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
The supply chain management process involves the following key activities:
Planning: Matching demand with supply.
Sourcing: Finding vendors for goods and services.
Making: Manufacturing or assembling products.
Delivering: Transporting products to customers.
Returning: Handling returns or reverse logistics.
Supply chain management (SCM) is the centralized management of the flow of goods and services to and from a company and includes all of the processes involved in transforming raw materials and components into final products.
With SCM, companies can cut excess costs and deliver products to the consumer faster and more efficiently.
Good SCM can help prevent expensive product recalls and lawsuits as well as bad publicity. 
The five most critical phases of SCM are planning, sourcing, production, distribution, and returns.
A supply chain manager is tasked with controlling and reducing costs and avoiding supply shortages.

5 Phases of Supply Chain Management (SCM): 
A supply chain manager's job is not only about traditional logistics and purchasing.
They have to find ways to increase efficiency and keep costs down while also avoiding shortages and preparing for unexpected contingencies. 
Typically, the SCM process consists of these five phases:

1. Planning
To get the best results from SCM, the process usually begins with planning to match supply with customer and manufacturing demands. Companies must try to predict what their future needs will be and act accordingly. That means taking into account the raw materials or components needed during each stage of manufacturing, equipment capacity and limitations, and staffing needs.

Large businesses often rely on enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to help coordinate the process.

2. Sourcing
Effective SCM processes rely very heavily on strong relationships with suppliers. Sourcing entails working with vendors to supply the materials needed throughout the manufacturing process. Different industries will have different sourcing requirements. In general, SCM sourcing involves ensuring that:

The raw materials or components meet the manufacturing specifications needed for the production of the goods.
The prices paid to the vendor are in line with market expectations.
The vendor has the flexibility to deliver emergency materials due to unforeseen events.
The vendor has a proven record of delivering goods on time and of good quality.
SCM is especially critical when manufacturers are working with perishable goods.
3. Manufacturing
Using machinery and labor to transform the raw materials or components the company has received from its suppliers into something new is the heart of the supply chain management process. 
This final product is the ultimate goal of the manufacturing process, though it is not the final stage of SCM.

The manufacturing process may be further divided into sub-tasks such as assembly, testing, inspection, and packaging.
During the manufacturing process, companies must be mindful of waste or other factors that may cause deviations from their original plans.
For example, if a company is using more raw materials than planned and sourced for due to inadequate employee training, it must rectify the issue or revisit the earlier stages in SCM.

4. Delivery
Once products are made and sales are finalized, a company must get those products into the hands of its customers.
A company with effective SCM will have robust logistic capabilities and delivery channels to ensure timely, safe, and inexpensive delivery of its products.

This includes having a backup or diversified distribution methods should one method of transportation temporarily be unusable.
For example, how might a company's delivery process be impacted by record snowfall in distribution center areas?

5. Returns
The SCM process concludes with support for the product and customer returns.

The return process is often called reverse logistics, and the company must ensure it has the capabilities to receive returned products and correctly assign refunds for them. 
Whether a company is conducting a product recall or a customer is simply not satisfied with the product, the transaction with the customer must be remedied.

Returns can also be a valuable form of feedback, helping the company to identify defective or poorly designed products and to make whatever changes are necessary. 
Without addressing the underlying cause of a customer return, the SCM process will have failed, and returns will likely persist into the future.
